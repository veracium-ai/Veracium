# Feature spec: on-disk store migrations

Spec-Status: in review

## 0. Why this is a spec and not a section of `0006`

**The scope cut put the migration contract in `0006` §0b. That was wrong, for
two reasons the reviewer named.**

1. **`0006` is a `draft` whose central mechanism (§3) is explicitly falsified.**
   Hanging every other schema-changing spec off it makes them wait on an
   unrelated, unresolved trust design.
2. **The dependency would not be expressible.** The gate reads a spec's direct
   `Spec-Requires:` entries; it cannot infer that adding a table needs migration
   work that happens to live inside a source-identity spec.

**So the graph is now:**

```
0013  requires 0007                (versioning must exist before shape changes)
0006  requires 0007, 0013
0008  requires 0007, 0013          <- the accepted spec whose gate the cut broke
0009  requires 0007, 0013
0010  requires 0007, 0013
```

**And the conclusions below are stated here in full, not cited.** The v9 archive
(`specs/archives/0007-v9-20260803T0056Z.tar.gz`) holds the working text, but the
archive policy says plainly that a hash of a file nobody kept proves nothing —
**a spec must not depend on a tarball on one developer's machine.**

---

## 1. Problem and motivation

**A schema change with no migration path strands every existing store.**

`0007` gives a store a version and refuses what it does not recognise. That is
exactly the right behaviour and it is also the problem: the first spec to change
the shape turns every store in the field into an unrecognised one. Without a
migration, `0007`'s refusal is the *only* outcome.

**The requirement that must survive**, established by `0007`'s first external
review round and never overturned since:

> **A user upgrading across a schema change must not be required to install
> every intermediate release.** A store presenting `user_version = 0` with a
> version-1 shape to a version-2 build must resolve to base 1 and migrate
> forward — not be refused as foreign.

**Why this is opening now and not with `0007`:** seven review rounds of `0007`
produced ~63 findings, the large majority in migration machinery that had **no
users** — the registry was empty and there was one schema version. Landing a
mechanism before its first user meant each rewrite introduced the next round's
defect. **`0013` is designed against a real migration**: `0008`'s
`confirmations` table, or `0006`'s new column, whichever lands first.

---

## 2. Field contracts touched

| field | read / written | contract | consumers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`MIGRATIONS`** | **NEW** — a registry of declared steps | one step per version transition | the open path, evidence generation |
| `MANIFESTS` (`0007`) | **written to** | `0007` already declares it a **set** per version, for exactly this reason | open, migrate |
| `PRAGMA user_version` (`0007`) | unchanged | `0007` owns stamping | — |

**No trust-bearing field changes.** Like `0007`, this spec adds no capability;
it constrains how a store may change shape.

---

## 3. Trust-class matrix — REQUIRED, blocking

**Not applicable — no trust class is read or written.** Stated rather than
omitted. The trust-relevant property is `0007`'s: every invariant in
`0002`–`0006` assumes the bytes on disk mean what this build thinks they mean,
and a migration is the one operation that deliberately changes them.

---

## 4. Behaviour — the conclusions that survived external review

**Each of these cost at least one round of `0007` review to find. They are
carried forward as the starting position, not as settled law** — this spec has
had no review of its own.

### 4a. Migrations are declarative

```python
class Migration(NamedTuple):
    from_version: int
    to_version: int
    statements: tuple[str, ...]      # executed in order, by the planner alone
```

**Not a Python callback.** `0007` v5 gave migrations a proxy whose connection
was name-mangled and claimed transaction control was unreachable "by
construction". Round 5 recovered it in one line —
`executor._MigrationExecutor__conn` — and ended the outer transaction. **Name
mangling is not access control**, and a false containment claim is worse than an
admitted trusted one.

### 4b. Effects are confined to persistent `main` schema

A declared statement can act where the manifest cannot see. Both measured:

| statement | result under the loose rule |
|---|---|
| `CREATE TEMP TRIGGER … BEGIN DELETE FROM t; END` | accepted · persistent manifest **byte-identical** · every inserted row silently deleted |
| `PRAGMA writable_schema=ON` | accepted · manifest unchanged · **still set afterwards** |

**Validating the persistent shape afterwards is only a complete check if effects
are confined to the persistent shape.** So an authorizer denies
`SQLITE_TRANSACTION`, `SQLITE_SAVEPOINT`, `SQLITE_ATTACH`, `SQLITE_DETACH` and
`SQLITE_PRAGMA`, and any action outside `main`; and `sqlite_temp_master` is
asserted empty after every step.

**Its role is stated honestly: defence against an accidental declared statement,
not a sandbox around hostile code.** It is restored in `finally` — left
installed it breaks the planner's own commit; left off after a failure it drops
containment for whatever runs next. **A migration runs only on a
Veracium-owned connection with no pre-existing authorizer**, because Python
exposes no portable getter for a prior callback.

`END`, `END TRANSACTION` and `RELEASE` all commit, and a keyword blacklist
missed all three — which is why this is an authorizer and not a text filter.

### 4c. A migration may not define its own destination

The generator once added **whatever a migration produced** to the destination's
accepted set. Measured: an **empty** migration from 1 to 2 was accepted as a
valid version 2, so a store missing a required table would have passed
validation.

**The destination requirement is independent of the migration.** What
authorises an output today is stated in §5 and §5c: **exact constructor
identity plus recorded path evidence** — nothing a migration produces enters
the accepted set on its own sayso.

### 4c-deferred. The structural-capability model — first `ALTER`, own review

*(Round 3: this subsection is **explicitly deferred design**, not present
contract — v4 still said capability "authorises", which contradicted §5/§5c's
correct statement that it is context only.)* An `ALTER`-class migration will
legitimately produce DDL text that differs from the constructor's, which is
the case a byte-for-byte rule wrongly rejects. When the first real `ALTER`
arrives, the deferred model — every declared object present and of the right
kind, columns compared via `table_xinfo` rather than DDL text, no unapproved
objects, rebuildable absence as repairable drift — gets its own external
review round before anything relies on it. Until then
`destination_problems()` is non-authorizing scaffolding, exact DDL text
remains what `0007`'s digest records, and **only exact identity and recorded
evidence authorise**.

### 4d. One step per transition

**Exactly one migration from `n` to `n+1`, validated against every accepted
manifest of `n`.** Route selection, cycles, non-adjacent steps and duplicate
edges become unrepresentable rather than rejected. What remains checkable:
adjacency, both versions declared, `SCHEMA_VERSION` agreeing with the registry,
and **every version below the current one having a route forward** — an accepted
source manifest with no path to the current version can never be opened.

### 4e. A version accepts a set of manifests, and evidence is per path

A constructor and an `ALTER` path legitimately produce different stored DDL:

```
fresh constructor:  … json TEXT NOT NULL, source_id TEXT )
ALTER TABLE:        … json TEXT NOT NULL , source_id TEXT)
```

So `MANIFESTS[v]` is a **set** — `0007` already declares it so — and **runtime
evidence records every path individually**, keyed `v<base>:constructor-><dest>`.
Keying by destination alone can record only one path per destination, while
different bases producing different exact output at the same destination is the
entire reason those digests exist.

---

## 5. The concrete migration — v1 → v2, the `confirmations` table

**Per the M-Q1 ruling, this spec is reviewed against a real migration.** The
first schema change is `0008`'s audit table, derived field-by-field from its
§6b–§6d:

```sql
CREATE TABLE confirmations (
    id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, user_id TEXT NOT NULL, edge_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    confirmed_at TEXT NOT NULL, actor TEXT NOT NULL, call_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    correlation_id TEXT NOT NULL, request_digest TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(user_id, correlation_id)
);
CREATE INDEX ix_confirmations_edge ON confirmations(user_id, edge_id);
```

| decision | from `0008` |
|---|---|
| `confirmed_at` stores the **normalised instant** | §6c — never the caller's string |
| `actor`, `call_path` are closed-enum **values** | §6c — free text in either was the bypass `actor` demonstrated |
| `correlation_id` **NOT NULL**; `UNIQUE(user_id, correlation_id)` | §6c — **an omitted id is *generated* by the library and returned as `str`**, so a value is always persisted; a NULL row could never identify its record on replay. "No replay protection" comes from the caller not retaining the value, not from NULL storage. Tenant-scoped per §6c's ruling — **and §6d's contradictory global line is corrected in `0008` itself, dated** |
| `id` **NOT NULL**, store-generated (`c-<12 hex>`) | round 2 measured `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` accepting multiple NULLs in a rowid table |
| `request_digest` mandatory | §6c — replay compares the canonical request; a same-id different-payload replay is an integrity conflict, not a lookup hit |
| the index is `REBUILDABLE` | `0007` §4a-iii — non-unique acceleration; the UNIQUE constraint lives in the table DDL and is therefore in the digest |
| **the migration is two `CREATE` statements** | §4a's declarative model; nothing else changes |

**A measured property the review should weigh:** because the change is purely
additive, the migration's stored DDL is **byte-identical** to the v2
constructor's — `MANIFESTS[2]` has one digest with two provenances. The
accepted-**set** model is still exercised (both paths are generated and
compared), but the `ALTER`-class divergence `0007` measured does not occur
here. **The set model earns its keep on the first `ALTER`, not on this
migration** — stated so the convergence is not mistaken for evidence that the
set was unnecessary.

**This migration is authorised by exact constructor identity, not
capability.** Round 2 demonstrated the column-only capability check stamping a
destination with `UNIQUE(correlation_id)` — global, violating `0008`'s tenant
scoping — and stamping a store missing its rebuildable index, which `0007`
would immediately call drifted. For a CREATE-only migration the byte-identical
constructor **is** the contract, so `open_or_migrate` now: applies the declared
statements → repairs rebuildable drift → recomputes the complete manifestation
→ **requires exact equality with the v2 constructor's** → stamps. Capability
is necessary context, never authorisation. **The general structural-capability
model is deferred to the first real `ALTER` and must be externally reviewed
there** — per the round-2 acceptance-bar ruling, not as accepted residual risk.

**Executable**: `specs/migrations_0013.py` and `tests/test_migrations_0013.py`
(55 tests: every round-2 and round-3 probe as a regression, the full inherited
planner across empty/unstamped/foreign/malformed/newer stores, the evidence
gate's adversarial records, confinement qualification, the closed failure
model, and the stale-connection hazard below).

**And there is exactly one planner** (round 3, finding 1). The instrument owns
no version-state machine: `open_or_migrate` / `migrate_store` install the
draft registry and the draft evidence artifact into the production `0007`
kernel — the state a v2 build would ship as package data — and call
`open_versioned()`, whose **older-row hook** is the seam `0007` §4 delegates
to this spec. Ordinary opening installs a refusing hook (classify the source,
then `migration-required`); the dedicated offline operation installs the
migrating hook (§5b–§5c). Every other row — new, legacy, foreign, current
with drift repair, stamped-wrong, newer, locked, unsupported — is the
kernel's own code, which is why a stamped v1 store with an unauthorized extra
table now answers `stamped-shape-mismatch` (round 3 measured it being
promised a migration), and a table squatting a rebuildable index name is a
closed refusal via the typed digest rather than an `OperationalError` from a
repair statement.

## 5b. M-Q2 RULED: adopt with conditions — the lock serialises, it does not fence

**Round 2's ruling, recorded.** `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` under the §4c protocol is
**approved as migration mutual exclusion** — verified by the reviewer with five
separate *processes*, one `migrated`, four `current`. **It is not
mixed-version fencing**, and v2 claimed more than the lock provides.

**The hazard, measured** (`test_mq2_hazard_a_stale_v1_connection_writes_after_migration`):
a connection opened *before* the migration never re-runs the version gate, so
an already-running v1 process keeps applying v1 behaviour to the v2 store. For
`0008` that is precisely the unaudited clearing path the whole chain exists to
close.

**So the deployment quiescence contract is part of this spec, load-bearing:**

| before a migrating release is admitted | |
|---|---|
| all old application processes stopped | no old worker retains an open connection |
| migration performed before service admission | old binaries prevented from restarting against the migrated store |
| backup taken; rollback procedure in place | a "one-way" declaration is not a fence |

**The boundary is a mechanism, and its claim is exactly this** (round 3
narrowed the wording): **ordinary opening cannot initiate migration; the
trusted deployment authority owns quiescence, old-binary fencing, and backup
validity.** The stale-process race is not "gone" — the library cannot see
other processes — it is *owned*, explicitly, by the party that can.

Migration is a **dedicated operation** (`migrate_store`), never a parameter on
tenant-facing opening — `open_or_migrate` has no authority argument at all
(round 3). The `MigrationAuthority` is an **attestation the library validates
but cannot verify**, so it is exact-typed and **bound to what it authorises**:
`quiesced` must be exactly `True` (a truthy `1` refused — round 3 measured
`MigrationAuthority(quiesced=1, backup_ref=object())` migrating), and the
authority carries `store_path`, `migration_digest` (the declaration digest of
the reviewed step), `operation_id`, `backup_ref` and `issued_at`, each
validated for exact type and binding. **Production authorities are minted by
release tooling and must additionally bind the release/deployment identity
and validate issuance freshness** — recorded here as an implementation
obligation for the first migrating release. `allow_adopt` never doubles as
migration permission.

*(v2's §8 said "not multi-process" while §5b demonstrated five concurrent
openers — the contradiction is resolved as above: concurrent **cooperating**
openers are serialised by the lock; **stale** openers are the operational
contract's problem.)*

## 5c. Path evidence: recorded, validated, consumed — never re-derived

**Round 3's central finding: v4 generated its "expected" record from the
currently loaded migration code, so an altered migration authorised itself.**
Measured — `DELETE FROM edges` appended to the declared statements produced
the exact v2 schema, stamped `migrated`, and left zero edge rows; exact schema
identity cannot detect data destruction. **The correction is architectural:
evidence is a committed, immutable artifact that the planner LOADS; the live
code contributes only a digest to match against.**

The artifact — `specs/generated/migration_0013_evidence.json`, the M11/M12
draft forms — is generated by `migrations_0013.py --write-evidence` on a
runtime being qualified, verified by `--check-evidence` (structural validation
plus exact re-derivation on the recording runtime), and consumed by
`migrate_store`. One path record carries:

```
migration_evidence_algorithm · manifest_algorithm · runtime build identity
from_version  · source acceptance digest · source FULL-manifest hash
to_version    · output acceptance digest · output FULL-manifest hash
              · complete output manifestation
migration declaration digest · provenance
```

**Record-level consistency rules, enforced by the validator** (round 3):

```
hash(complete output manifestation) == output full-manifest hash
digest(complete output manifestation) == output acceptance digest
source identifiers resolve to exactly ONE accepted source manifestation
output identifiers resolve to exactly ONE accepted destination manifestation
```

**Selection at migration time is over the full frozen key**: runtime build
identity × source version × source acceptance digest × source full-manifest
hash × destination version × **migration declaration digest** (sha256 over
domain-separated canonical JSON of `[from, to, [statements…]]` —
`canonical_migration_bytes()`). Exactly one record or the migration does not
run: an altered migration — even one producing the identical schema — digests
differently, matches nothing, and refuses `migration-evidence-missing` with
data and stamp untouched. **Cardinality is exact** against the live registry:
every declared step × every accepted source manifestation for the current
runtime has exactly one record; missing, extra, duplicate, stale-algorithm or
contradictory records each fail closed, and each has an adversarial test.
After execution the complete output is repaired, recomputed and compared
against the record's manifestation, acceptance digest AND full-manifest hash
before any stamp — full-manifest hashes because the acceptance digest is
blind to rebuildables by design (round 2, measured).

**Migration confinement is itself runtime-qualified** (round 3, finding 3).
`0007`'s runtime identity deliberately carries no authorizer probe — migration
left its scope in v10 — so its qualification cannot attest the behaviours
§4b's confinement leans on. The artifact therefore records a
**migration-runtime qualification** per build identity: authorizer API
available; `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`END`, savepoints and `RELEASE`, `PRAGMA`,
`ATTACH`/`DETACH`, and TEMP-schema effects each **observed and denied**;
restoration after rejection verified. All eleven probes are required, and
consumption does not trust the record: the probes are re-run live and compared
— mirroring how `0007`'s `runtime_supported()` re-derives constructor
manifestations. `migrate_store` requires **both** the schema-runtime and the
migration-runtime qualification before touching the store; ordinary opening
requires only `0007`'s, because it executes no confined statement.

## 5d. The closed outcome contract

**Total over expected store, SQLite, evidence, authority and protocol
failures** (round 3, finding 4 — v4 leaked `sqlite3.OperationalError` from
invalid SQL and free-form strings like `unexpected version 0`):

| failure class | closed outcome |
|---|---|
| lock acquisition exhausted | `locked` |
| unqualified schema- or migration-runtime, poisoned schema evidence | `unsupported-sqlite` |
| source not an accepted manifestation | `stamped-shape-mismatch` / `foreign-shape` |
| invalid or unbound authority | `migration-quiescence-required` |
| absent, ambiguous, inconsistent or non-matching path evidence | `migration-evidence-missing` |
| SQL execution or protocol failure during the migration | `migration-failed` |
| executed output differs from the recorded output | `migration-result-mismatch` |

Successes are equally closed: `created` · `adopted` · `current` · `migrated`.
The entry points return an `Outcome` — a value that string-compares as its
closed member and carries diagnostics separately, and that **refuses to exist
outside the vocabulary**. Detailed exception text rides the diagnostic, never
the branch value. One deliberate exception, inherited from `0007`'s reviewed
behaviour: package-consistency impossibilities (the constructor disagreeing
with the build's own shipped evidence) raise, because they are properties of a
broken package, not of the store on disk.

## 6. Invariants and executable checks — REQUIRED, blocking

**The store contains no migration code — `0013` authorises nothing.** The
rows below marked with test names now run against the **draft instrument**
(`specs/migrations_0013.py`) and the concrete migration; they become store
tests at implementation.

| invariant | executable check |
|---|---|
| **M1** a declared step runs inside the caller's transaction | `test_the_executor_requires_an_existing_transaction` — **measured today**; and exercised by every instrument test via the shared `0007` planner |
| **M2** transaction control in a declared statement is denied | `test_transaction_control_and_pragmas_are_denied` — **measured today**, six forms |
| **M3** temp objects are refused | `test_a_temp_object_is_refused` — **measured today** |
| **M4** pragmas are refused | `test_transaction_control_and_pragmas_are_denied` — **measured today** |
| **M5** the authorizer is restored after failure | `test_the_authorizer_is_restored_after_failure` — **measured today** |
| **M6** an empty migration cannot authorise its output | `test_an_empty_migration_cannot_authorize_its_output` — **measured today**, against the real `confirmations` requirement |
| **M7** a correct migration reaches its declared destination | `test_the_concrete_migration_reaches_the_v2_constructor_output` — **measured today**; output byte-identical to the constructor |
| **M8** a partial or wrong-shape result is rejected | `test_a_partial_migration_is_rejected` — **measured today** |
| **M9** the registry is well-formed | `test_m9_the_draft_registry_is_well_formed` · `test_a_gap_refuses` — **measured today** |
| **M10** a skipped release still upgrades | **NOT demonstrated, and not claimed** (round 2, finding 7). `0013` today authorises the concrete adjacent v1→v2 only; the multi-step planner is reviewed at the first spec needing two real steps |
| **M11** every migration path is keyed individually | **draft form measured today**: the committed artifact keys records by runtime × source digest+hash × destination × declaration digest — `test_the_committed_evidence_artifact_is_valid_and_reproduces`. Production artifact lands with `0008` |
| **M12** runtime evidence covers every declared path | **draft form measured today**: exact cardinality against the live registry — `test_an_absent_path_record_refuses` · `test_a_duplicate_path_record_refuses` · `test_a_stale_algorithm_record_is_superseded_not_consumed`. Production with `0008` |
| **M13** migration runs exactly once among cooperating openers | `test_mq2_concurrent_migration_runs_exactly_once`, and the reviewer's independent five-**process** run. **The stale-opener hazard is measured, not solved** — §5b's quiescence contract. |
| **M14** an altered migration cannot authorise itself | `test_a_data_destructive_alteration_cannot_authorize_itself` · `test_a_side_effect_free_alteration_is_still_not_evidenced` — **measured today**: refusal before execution, data and stamp untouched |
| **M15** migration confinement is runtime-qualified, independently of `0007`'s gate | `test_the_migration_runtime_gate_is_independent_of_0007s` · `test_recorded_confinement_behaviours_must_reproduce_live` · `test_the_authorizer_probes_all_hold_on_this_runner` — **measured today** |
| **M16** every outcome is a member of the closed vocabulary | `test_invalid_sql_returns_migration_failed_not_an_exception` · `test_a_wrong_unique_constraint_is_a_result_mismatch` · `test_the_outcome_vocabulary_is_closed` — **measured today** |

---

## 7. Failure modes and reversibility

**Failure is refusal to open, which is loud and safe.** The unacceptable failure
is opening and silently misreading — `0007`'s framing, unchanged.

**A real migration is not reversible**, and this is the spec that has to say so.
`0007` §7 already carries the operational downgrade contract: a pre-migration
backup, no downgrade to a pre-`0007` binary, installer fencing where the
packaging supports it, loud release documentation, and a recovery path from the
backup. **A declaration that a migration is "one-way" is not a fence.**

---

## 8. Claims and limits

**Claim, bounded (round 2):** a version-1 store can be brought to version 2 by
the declared migration under an explicit offline authority, or is refused with
a closed reason. **Skipped-release upgrading is not claimed** — it is the
mandatory requirement the first two-step spec must demonstrate.

**Limits:**

- **Cooperating concurrent openers are serialised** by the write lock (§5b);
  **stale old-version processes are unsupported unless quiesced** — the
  distinction round 2 required in place of v3's contradictory "not
  multi-process" line.
- **The `MigrationAuthority` is an attestation, not a verification** — ruled
  acceptable at the library boundary in round 3: a library cannot prove every
  process on the host has stopped, so it refuses without the attestation,
  validates its types and bindings exactly, and never auto-migrates. What the
  host attests, the host owns.
- **Not a sandbox.** §4b's authorizer defends against an accidental declared
  statement. **Migration statements are trusted code.**
- **Not equivalence.** A third-party database that is equivalent but differently
  written is refused, per `0007` §4a.
- **Bounded by the qualified runtimes.** `0007`'s runtime gate applies; a
  migration path's output must be recorded per qualified runtime.

## 9. Brief for the external reviewer

**Round 4 of this spec. All four round-3 blockers taken; every executable
probe reproduced first** — the `unexpected version 0` answers, the
self-authorising `DELETE FROM edges` migration (edges destroyed, `migrated`
stamped), the never-consulted source hash, the escaped `OperationalError`,
and `MigrationAuthority(quiesced=1, backup_ref=object())`.

1. **One planner, actually** (finding 1): the second state machine is deleted.
   The instrument installs the draft registry and evidence into the production
   kernel and calls `open_versioned()`, with `0013` supplying only the
   older-row hook `0007` §4 delegates. Your probes are regressions: empty →
   `created`; unstamped v1 → `migration-required` / `migrated`; foreign v0 →
   `foreign-shape`; stamped v1 with an intruder table →
   `stamped-shape-mismatch` from **both** operations; table squatting the
   index name → closed refusal, no exception.
2. **Evidence is loaded, not manufactured** (finding 2): the committed
   artifact carries schema, runtime, migration-runtime and path records;
   `--write-evidence` generates, `--check-evidence` re-derives, the planner
   selects by the full frozen key including the declaration digest. Your
   `DELETE` and `SELECT 1` probes refuse `migration-evidence-missing` with
   data and stamp untouched; your zeroed source hash fails both the record's
   consistency rules and selection. The record now also resolves its
   **output** to an accepted destination manifestation, symmetric with the
   source rule.
3. **Confinement is qualified where it is used** (finding 3): eleven
   authorizer probes per build identity — transaction/savepoint/pragma/
   attach/detach/temp-schema each observed and denied, restoration verified —
   recorded in the artifact and **re-verified live at consumption**.
   `migrate_store` requires both gates; ordinary opening only `0007`'s.
4. **The outcome vocabulary is closed and total** (finding 4): invalid SQL
   under matching evidence → `migration-failed`; a wrong result under
   matching evidence → `migration-result-mismatch`, rolled back; free-form
   strings are unrepresentable. §5d states the one deliberate exception
   (package-consistency impossibilities raise, per `0007`'s reviewed
   behaviour).

**The additional corrections**: §4c's capability model is explicitly deferred
design with the present-tense authorisation claim removed; the simulator
stops cleanly (rc 2) after a runtime refusal; §5b carries your narrowed M-Q2
wording verbatim and the authority binding contract; §5c carries the
record-level consistency rules; the package README states the measured
3.46.1 behaviour.

**Where I am least confident:** the boundary between what the draft
instrument demonstrates and what remains implementation-time (M11/M12
production artifacts, release-tooling-minted authorities binding release
identity). Both are recorded as obligations with their draft forms measured;
whether that split is acceptable for `0013`'s acceptance is yours to rule.

## 10. Open questions

| # | question | class | who | by when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~M-Q1~~ | **RULED by round 9, 2026-08-03: wait.** `0013` must not reach `accepted` before it is reviewed **against an actual migration** — that is the principle that justified the `0007` scope cut, and it applies equally to the replacement. **The first case is `0008`'s `confirmations` table**: accepted, simple, additive, already blocked on `0013`, and independent of `0006`'s unresolved source-identity design. **`0013` may generalise only what that real migration demonstrates.** | resolved | external | — |
| ~~M-Q2~~ | **RULED (round 1) adopt-with-conditions; condition RESOLVED (round 2) by the offline boundary; boundary APPROVED (round 3) at the library level** with the narrowed claim (§5b: ordinary opening cannot initiate migration; the trusted deployment authority owns quiescence, fencing and backup validity) and the authority binding conditions (exact types, bound to store/migration/operation; release-identity binding at implementation). | resolved | external | — |
| ~~M-Q3~~ | **RULED by round 9: yes, it belongs here.** The capability comparison exists to decide whether a *migration result* satisfies its destination despite differing DDL, so it is `0013`'s. `0007` retains exact manifestation identity, digest comparison, rebuildable drift and candidate resolution — and `capability_problems()` has been removed from its kernel. | resolved | external | — |

## 11. Round 1 review disposition

**Verdict: architecture approved directionally; v2 deferred.** 7 findings, all
taken; the acceptance bar was answered — narrow `0013` to what this migration
demonstrates, and reopen the general model at the first `ALTER`.

| # | finding | closed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `correlation_id` nullable contradicts §6c; `id` accepts NULLs; `0008` §6d contradicts §6c | **DDL corrected** — both NOT NULL, generation model stated; **`0008` §6d corrected in place, dated** |
| 2 | column-only capability stamped a wrong-UNIQUE destination | **exact constructor identity** authorises this migration; regression test rolls it back |
| 3 | capability treated as authorisation; path identity too weak | **§5c freezes the evidence record** — runtime × source digest × output digest × declaration digest; capability is context only |
| 4 | missing rebuildable index stamped unrepaired | **repair before stamp**, then exact-identity revalidation; regression test |
| 5 | the write lock does not fence a stale v1 process | **M-Q2 ruled adopt-with-conditions**; hazard measured as a test; **quiescence contract is spec text**, enforceability an implementation obligation |
| 6 | a stray 2→3 step validated | **exact key sets both directions**, nonempty statement tuples; regression test |
| 7 | skipped-release not demonstrated | **claim withdrawn and bounded**: adjacent v1→v2 only; the planner is reviewed at the first two-step spec |

## 12. Round 2 review disposition

**Verdict: concrete migration and direction approved; v3 deferred.** 4
blockers, 4 inconsistencies, all taken.

| # | finding | closed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the instrument bypassed `0007`'s gates | **integrated planner** — runtime gate first; *current* validates + repairs; malformed stamped v2 refuses. Regression tests for both probes |
| 2 | path evidence attested less than it authorised | **full-manifest hashes** (acceptance digest is rebuildable-blind, measured); defined canonical bytes; exact cardinality; complete output reproduced |
| 3 | quiescence was prose over auto-migration | **offline boundary**: `migration-required` on ordinary open; `MigrationAuthority`; closed failure model. M-Q2's condition resolved |
| 4 | one-transaction was a calling convention | **executable precondition**, re-checked per statement; the autocommit partial-migration case is a regression |

---

## 13. Round 3 review disposition

**Verdict: concrete v1→v2 approved directionally; v4 deferred for a focused
v5.** Four load-bearing guarantees were false in the executable instrument;
all four taken, plus the M-Q2 ruling and every additional correction.

| # | finding | closed by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the "integrated planner" was a second hand-written state machine — empty and unstamped stores answered `unexpected version 0`; a malformed stamped source was promised `migration-required`; a squatting table raised `OperationalError` | **the second machine is deleted.** The instrument installs the draft registry + evidence into the production kernel and calls `open_versioned()`; `0007` gains the older-row hook its §4 always delegated to `0013`. Adversarial tests across empty / unstamped / foreign / malformed±authority / squatting-name stores |
| 2 | path evidence was generated from the live migration code — an appended `DELETE FROM edges` authorised itself; the recorded source hash was never consulted; the record omitted the frozen contract's fields | **evidence is a committed artifact** (`migration_0013_evidence.json`): generator, validator (record-level consistency rules incl. output resolution), and consuming planner all exist in the draft; selection over the full frozen key; both alteration probes refuse `migration-evidence-missing`, data and stamp untouched |
| 3 | `0007`'s runtime qualification cannot attest authorizer behaviour | **migration-runtime qualification**: eleven required confinement probes per build identity, recorded and re-verified live at consumption; `migrate_store` requires both gates |
| 4 | the closed failure model leaked raw exceptions and free-form strings | **total mapping** to the closed vocabulary; `Outcome` refuses non-members; `migration-failed` and `migration-result-mismatch` demonstrably reachable via crafted-evidence tests; §5d states the package-consistency exception |
| M-Q2 | attestation model | **approved at the library boundary** with narrowed wording (§5b verbatim) and binding conditions: exact-typed authority bound to store, migration digest and operation; release-identity binding and freshness at implementation; no authority parameter on tenant-facing opening |
| a | §4c still said capability "authorises" | moved to §4c-deferred, present-tense claim removed |
| b | simulator crashed past its own refusal | gates first; clean `rc 2` on an unqualified runtime — regression test |
| c | README claimed five failing tests on 3.46.1 | package README states the measured behaviour and the artifact-regeneration path |
| d | §5c lacked record-level consistency rules | the four rules (plus output resolution) are spec text with adversarial tests for missing / extra / stale-algorithm / duplicate / contradictory records |
