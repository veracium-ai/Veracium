"""One row per REVIEW FINDING, with the evidence that closes it.

External round 5, R5-3. `render_closure.py` generated one row per ROUND with
the verdict truncated to 300 characters, and PROCESS §4a requires one row per
FINDING with an openable command, test or commit. A round-level summary is not
a closure ledger; it is a shorter verdict.

`evidence` is a STRING A REVIEWER CAN RUN OR OPEN — a pytest node id, a
harness invocation, a `git show`, a `grep`. Not "see §4f". The rule this
project keeps relearning is that a claim with no executable behind it decays
into prose, and this field is where that is refused.

`closed_in` names the carrier(s) the fix landed in, so a reader can check the
fix is where the ledger says it is.
